# API Key Generator

A modern and secure **API Key Generator** built with **PyQt5**. This application allows users to generate customizable and secure API keys with various filters for enhanced security. The tool is designed with a sleek, dark-themed UI and provides a seamless experience for developers to quickly generate API keys with ease.

## Features

### 1. **Customizable Key Filters**
   - **Key Length**: Choose the desired length of the API key (from 8 to 64 characters).
   - **Include Numbers**: Option to include numeric characters in the API key.
   - **Include Uppercase Letters**: Option to include uppercase letters.
   - **Include Lowercase Letters**: Option to include lowercase letters.
   - **Include Special Characters**: Option to include special characters (`!@#$%^&*` etc.).
   - **Remove Ambiguous Characters**: Option to exclude visually similar characters such as `l`, `I`, `O`, `0` to avoid confusion.

### 2. **Generate API Key**
   - Generate a secure API key based on user-selected filters.
   - Key generation is completely random, ensuring a high level of security.

### 3. **Copy to Clipboard**
   - Once the API key is generated, you can easily copy it to the clipboard with a single click.
   - The application logs every action, so you can track generated keys and copied keys.

### 4. **Logs Section**
   - A **logs section** at the bottom of the UI shows activity in real-time, such as key generation and copy actions.
   - Logs are displayed in a clean green color, providing a professional look and feel.

### 5. **Clean & Modern UI**
   - The user interface is built with **PyQt5**, featuring a dark theme with white text for better contrast.
   - The sidebar provides key metadata about the application, including:
     - Developed on
     - Last updated
     - Version number
     - Developer's name
     - Special thanks to contributors
     - Instructions on how to use the tool

## Future Enhancements

While this application is fully functional, here are some **future enhancements** that could be implemented to improve its functionality and user experience:

1. **Advanced Encryption Option**:
   - Add an option to encrypt the generated API key using various algorithms (e.g., AES) before displaying it.

2. **Save API Keys**:
   - Allow users to save generated API keys to a local file or a database for future use.

3. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication (sign-up/sign-in) for a more personalized experience.
   - This would be useful for keeping track of generated API keys by users.

4. **API Key Expiration**:
   - Add an expiration date for the generated API keys. Users could specify when their API keys should expire, and the application could alert them when itâ€™s time to regenerate the key.

5. **Multi-Language Support**:
   - Add support for multiple languages to cater to users worldwide.

6. **API Integration**:
   - Implement an API that allows users to generate API keys directly from a web application or from a REST API.

7. **Enhanced Key Customization**:
   - Allow for more advanced customization of the key generation process (e.g., specific character sets, prefixes, and suffixes).
